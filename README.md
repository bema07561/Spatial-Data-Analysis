## Road Network Operation

**Technologies Used:** NetworkX, OSMnx, Python

- **Description:** Constructed a comprehensive routable road network using OpenStreetMap data.
- **Features:**
  - Implemented shortest path algorithms to determine optimal routes.
  - Visualized road networks and routing paths for better understanding and presentation.
- **Highlights:**
  - Utilized NetworkX for graph-based network operations.
  - Leveraged OSMnx to easily download and model street networks from OpenStreetMap.

## Spatial Databases

**Technologies Used:** Python

- **Description:** Developed in-memory spatial databases to efficiently handle Points of Interest (POI) data.
- **Features:**
  - Implemented range queries to find POIs within a specified area.
  - Developed nearest neighbor queries to identify the closest POIs to a given location.
- **Highlights:**
  - Demonstrated the efficiency of spatial indexing techniques in optimizing query performance.

## Intelligent Cancer Diagnosis

**Technologies Used:** Scikit-learn, Python

- **Description:** Created a machine learning model for the binary classification of breast cancer datasets.
- **Features:**
  - Applied various classifiers to distinguish between malignant and benign tumors.
  - Optimized hyperparameters to enhance model accuracy and reliability.
- **Highlights:**
  - Achieved high classification performance through careful model tuning and validation.

## Yelp Data Analysis

**Technologies Used:** Pandas, Scikit-learn, Python

- **Description:** Conducted an in-depth analysis of the Yelp dataset to uncover meaningful insights.
- **Features:**
  - Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand data distributions and relationships.
  - Created visualizations to illustrate key findings and trends.
  - Validated theoretical concepts using real-world data scenarios.
- **Highlights:**
  - Leveraged Pandas for efficient data manipulation and preprocessing.
  - Utilized Scikit-learn for implementing machine learning techniques in the analysis.
